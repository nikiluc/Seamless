# Seamless
A playlist generator using Spotify and LastFM APIs and React.js.

A personal project, wanted to find songs that were similar to each other with similar genre and tempo being the priority. Ensure that all of the libraries have been installed and the files are in the same directory. Then:

Open two terminal windows and run 'npm start' in the first one (frontend) and 'npm run start-flask-api' (backend) in the second one.
